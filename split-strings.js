/* Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters
If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_')

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef'] */

function solution(str) {
    const pairs = []; // this declares a constant variable 'pairs' and initializes it to an empty array. This array will hold the pairs of characters that we generate
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 2) { // this is a 'for' loop that iterates over the input string, two characters at a time. It initializes the loop variable 'i' to 0, sets the loop condition to 'i < str.length' (i.e., the loop will run until 'i' reaches the length of the input string), and increments 'i' by 2 on each iteration (to skip over the second character of each pair)
      const pair = str.slice(i, i + 2); // this uses the 'slice' method to extract a substring of length 2 starting at index 'i' in the input string. The 'slice' method returns a new string that is a copy of the original string, starting at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters
      if (pair.length === 2) { // this is an 'if' statement that checks whether the 'pair' substring has length 2. If it does, we push it onto the 'pairs' array as is. If it has length 1 (i.e., it's the final character of an odd-length string), we append an underscore to it before pushing it onto the 'pairs' array
        pairs.push(pair);
      } else { // if the substring has length 1, append an underscore to it before pushing it onto the pairs array
        pairs.push(pair + '_'); //is a way to append a string to the end of an array. It's used in the code to handle the case where the input string has an odd number of characters, where the last pair should have an underscore character appended to it

  /* this code uses a simple for loop to iterate over the input string two characters at a time, and it uses the slice method to extract substrings of length 2. 
    It also checks whether the final substring has length 1 and appends an underscore if necessary. 
    Finally, it returns an array of pairs of characters.*/
