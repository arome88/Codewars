//Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.
//Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

//This is the function declaration, defining a function called 'reverseSeq' that takes one parameter, 'n' 
//this function is defined using an arrow function expression
const reverseSeq = n => {
    return [5,4,3,2,1];
    //This statement returns an array of integers from 5 to 1, which is hard-coded into the function
    //the array is defined using square brackets [ ], and the integers are separated by commas.
